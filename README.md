## Introduction

Test automation is the process of using software tools and frameworks to automate test execution, compare actual outcomes to expected outcomes, and generate test reports. This helps to increase efficiency, accuracy, and repeatability of testing processes, as well as reducing the time and costs associated with manual testing. <br><br>In here we are going to test SWAG Labs (Sauce Demo - https://www.saucedemo.com). We are going to use tools and test frameworks like TestNG with Selenium for the automation. This project focuses on automating tests for the Swag Labs website using Selenium.

## Scope

The project covers the following areas of the Swag Labs website:

- Login page
- Navigation Bar
- Footer Bar
- Home page, including product list and product detail.
- Checkout product

## Features

- Uses Selenium for interacting with web elements and performing automated actions.
- Organizes test scenarios using TestNG testing framework.
- Includes a wide range of test cases covering login, checkout product functionality, and more.
- Provides easy-to-understand bug reports and test outcomes.


## Tools and Technologies Used

This test automation project for Swag Labs utilizes a variety of tools and technologies to streamline the testing process and ensure efficient and accurate results.

- **Java**: The primary programming language used for writing the test automation code.

- **Selenium**: A popular open-source framework for automating web browser interactions and testing.

- **TestNG**: A popular and most widely used testing framework for Selenium automation.

- **ChromeDriver**: The WebDriver implementation for Google Chrome, enabling Selenium to automate Chrome browser actions.

- **Maven**: A build and dependency management tool that simplifies project setup and maintenance.

- **jira**:  Jira helps plan, track, and manage work the projects.

These technologies are combined to create an effective testing framework that automates test cases, performs comparisons between expected and actual outcomes, and generates detailed test reports.


## Test Cases

This section outlines the key test cases used to validate the functionality of the project. Each test ensures that the application behaves as expected under various conditions.

## Installation

Ensure that you have the following tools and technologies installed on your machine:

- [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/)

  <br><br>Note: Make sure to download the relavent Chrome driver version for your chrome browser match, and put it into project directory.


## Conclusion

The Swag Labs testing project successfully showcases the application of automated testing techniques using tools like Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and Java. By simulating real-world user interactions on an e-commerce platform the project validates critical functionalities such as:.
- User authentication (valid and invalid login scenarios)
- Product selection and cart operations
- Checkout workflows and form validations
- UI responsiveness and error handling
Through this project, we achieved:
- Robust test coverage across functional and UI components
- Reusable and maintainable test scripts with modular design
- Detailed reporting using Allure or ExtentReports
- Scalability for future enhancements like performance and security testing
